												<BR>	<b class ="yellowbackground"> You’ve been Djing and producing tracks for over 2 years now, how did it all begin for you? </b>
												<BR><BR> I always had a huge interest in dance music and DJ’ing from a very young age, my Dad was a Club DJ during my younger years so that influence was always there. I learnt how to play first on old basic rack mounted CD players then I bought cheap Turntables, then better ones (because I couldn't afford CDJ’s and then realised I couldn't afford Vinyl haha) and eventually I moved back to CDJ’s. From there I wanted to take it further and learn how to make the music I was playing. I took a course in 2008 in Temple Bar Music Centre with Timmy Gibson and Tommy Conway who were excellent, but I gave up soon after because we learnt on Reason which wasn’t really for me. Fast forward 3 years and a friend of mine showed me Ableton. Everything I had learned previously clicked straight away and I couldn't believe how easy it was to use the software. It took me about 2 years to find my sound and start releasing tracks. My first release was in 2013 and I just began building from there.
 
												<BR><BR> <b class ="yellowbackground"> Has it been difficult to establish yourself or did everything get moving quickly enough? </b>
												<BR><BR> I guess I’ve come a long way so far (or maybe just been at it a long time haha) but I’m still trying to establish myself properly in the sense of making this a professional full time paying job with the right management on an international level. I feel I’m nearly there (sometimes) but sometimes releases don't always go to plan and you’re left without enough consistent releases to get you there. But I hope it’s close. 
																								
												<BR><BR> <b class ="yellowbackground"> What has been the most easy and most difficult thing for you in promoting yourself as an Irish underground music producer? </b>
												<BR><BR> I feel that making tracks is the best way to promote yourself and get noticed and there lies the difficulty. It’s hard to lock down consistent releases sometimes and you can be up against so many other artists who are aiming for the same labels. I could run PR campaigns but you need to have the tracks to stand on first. Last year I had tracks rejected last minute that I’d been waiting for up to 2 years to get released. This year thankfully I’ve 4 Eps ready to go so a lot more music to release.
												
												<BR><BR> <b class ="yellowbackground"> Being an Irish producer and Dj you must come across a lot of Irish talent? </b>
												<BR><BR> We have amazing DJ’s and talent and yeah you see it all the time, you just have to look at the likes of the Higher Vision Festival lineup from last year or the local acts who play Life Festival or get down to a club early to see the local guys who are on support. You can have great nights in places like Pygmalion or Wha Wha club where local guys play all night. Those are some of the best nights. 
												
												<BR><BR> <b class ="yellowbackground"> Does being an underground music producer here in Ireland offer and benefits or draw-backs you wouldn’t get in other countries? </b>
												<BR><BR> Gig wise I think being such a small island the gigs aren’t always gonna be there, but we’re such a short hop by flight to the UK and Europe which are thriving. Music wise I’d never see it as a drawback really. Some people move away to Berlin or Ibiza etc for inspiration and that’s cool but it doesn’t always mean you’re gonna make better music. You could actually end up making the same music as everyone else. Having said that Ibiza is where I would love to live eventually, and you’re always gonna meet the right people there or in Berlin. But I wouldn’t expect myself personally to make better music from living anywhere else.	
												
												<BR><BR> <b class ="yellowbackground"> A big thing for Irish promoters is getting acts from abroad to play here in Ireland but how important do you think it is to showcase Irish talent? </b>
												<BR><BR> It’s highly important. It’s great to see promoters put up and coming local guys on support, especially the ones who are releasing regularly and who can play a good support set. Some venues are even filling now with local acts who’ve become so big which is great to see. And it’s up to clubbers too of course get down to events early and listen, dance and support.

												<BR><BR> <b class ="yellowbackground"> How does Irish talent compare with that to abroad? Is there a difference in style or the way artists go about things? </b>
												<BR><BR> There can be differences musically just from having a bit of perspective and not being too submerged in bigger scenes in other countries where a lot of stuff gets recycled. I know Matador said the same thing about not moving to Berlin because he wanted to sound different and he certainly does!

												<BR><BR> <b class ="yellowbackground"> How do you feel the underground scene here in Dublin is doing currently with respect to the past and other countries? </b>
												<BR><BR> It’s the best I’ve ever seen at the moment but I feel that apart from the very few big clubs such as District 8 and Button Factory it’s very much festival based. But these clubs are busy every weekend with big acts playing and it’s great to see. I know one or two are due to close unfortunately but somewhere else will always open because the demand is there.

												<BR><BR> <b class ="yellowbackground"> Why do you think its become so popular here in Dublin for acts to come and play? </b>
												<BR><BR> From a DJ perspective - the crowds are amazing and everyone loves the Irish. From a punter point of view - we simply love the buzz of seeing a great DJ play.

												<BR><BR> <b class ="yellowbackground"> Do you think the increased demand will stay? </b>
												<BR><BR> Yeah definitely. I don’t think underground House or Techno or anything in between is going away. Sometimes one genre might be more popular but it will always be there. 
												
												<BR><BR> <b class ="yellowbackground"> If you’re able to pin it to a particular time frame, when did the rise in demand for underground house and techno music here in Dublin begin? </b>
												<BR><BR> To completely generalise it - We’re definitely riding at the top of the most recent wave at the minute, I think around 2012/2013 for Dublin because before that we were in recession and nowhere was busy and before that a huge amount of people listened to Trance. So around 2012 onwards, again generalising there was huge popularity in Deep House and that definitely gave things a kick. The whole Deep House thing was good because it brought a lot of great crossover tracks and got people interested in a more underground scene. Social media has played a massive part too from those years onwards.
												
												<BR><BR> <b class ="yellowbackground"> Have the crowds or type of people attending these events ever changed much? </b>
												<BR><BR> Some acts and venues naturally attract different demographics so it’s too hard to say. I never let the crowd bother me anywhere once everyones having a good time and not pushing around or being aggressive.
												
												<BR><BR> <b class ="yellowbackground"> Do you feel current crowds are pushing for new / bigger names or is there a demand for the lesser-known names in more intimate venues? </b>
												<BR><BR> There certainly is a demand for lesser known names and that’s why places like Index are doing so well. Then on a smaller scale again you have places like Izakaya, Wigwam and Tengu doing some cool names.
												
												<BR><BR> <b class ="yellowbackground"> Have venues / nightclubs hosting underground house and techno events changed much from the past to present?  </b>
												<BR><BR> Yeah definitely. I started going out to proper clubs on weekends in my late teens sneaking into clubs like Redbox which even by todays standards in Dublin was amazing. Redbox then became Tripod which was a beautifully finished venue/club in a great location which unfortunately still sits on the top of Harcourt Street dormant. Don’t get me wrong I love a good Warehouse to dance or play in, but the likes of Tripod and Redbox were amazing and we really need a few more spaces like those to dance in in Dublin. Places that can be a club or a venue at the same time. In the UK for example you have the Printworks in London or the Abode Terrace, or the Warehouse Project in Manchester. They are amazing spaces to spend a day or night in and we need more of that.
												
												<BR><BR> <b class ="yellowbackground"> How big an issue is competition between artists in such a thriving environment? </b>
												<BR><BR> I would never really see another artist as a competitor, I always try to help other people with feedback or contacts or whatever. Artists might be aiming for the same label as you but if your tracks are good enough and suitable then you’ll get on that label too. With big artists and Djs such as Matador, John O’Callaghan and Krystal Klear all coming from Ireland, are there any Irish upcoming names you think we should watch out for? I’ll name a few who are definitely ones to watch - Quinton Cambell is doing really well and has had releases on Extended Play. Reuben Keeney had rebranded as Rebuke and has tracks coming on Saved Records. Mark Greene just had a track played by Carl Cox on his essential mix.
												
												<BR><BR> <b class ="yellowbackground"> Would you change anything about the Irish underground music scene at the moment and if so what? </b>
												<BR><BR> We need more clubs definitely. That or unique spaces to dance. This is part of our culture in Dublin so it needs to all fit in somewhere.
												
												<BR><BR> <b class ="yellowbackground"> Where do you think the Irish house and techno scene will be in 5 years time? </b>
												<BR><BR> I think it will still be huge, as some people stop going out, younger people start. But we need the clubs, venues and spaces to keep it alive, not just festivals.
