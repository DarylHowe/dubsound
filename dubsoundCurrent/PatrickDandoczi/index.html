												<BR>
												<b> DAW: </b> &nbsp Ableton Live   
												<BR><BR> <b> Favourite Plugin: </b> &nbsp Beatzille from U-he
												<BR><BR> <b> Monitors: </b> &nbsp Samson Resolv A6
												<BR><BR> <b> Headphones: </b> &nbsp HD-25s
												<BR><BR> <b> Top Production Tip: </b> &nbsp Don’t just f*** people in the ear with a very loud kick - create your own groove to move people and learn your software before moving on to plug-ins. For example, “Ableton” has everything you need inside of it, learn everything inside before going out for plug-ins
												<BR><BR> <b> House or Techno: </b> &nbsp I produce and mostly play Techno but I love listening to House in my spare time. I'm a big fan of going to certain House gigs too!

												<BR>	 With roots in both Ireland and Romania Patrick Dandoczi is a music producer who certainly offers his own unique perspective, style and sound on Techno. Dandoczi's tight production style gives his tracks a slightly more modern edge - an edge that many even seasoned producers struggle to achieve on a consistent basis. Everything about this guys music screams the word 'tight' - his mixing ability in the studio is next none and he has most definitely trained his ears at picking out those frequencies that work and sound so well.. ‘tight’. Patrick has recently been receiving huge support on his track 'Imperium' which was released on 'Subplot Records (UK)'. In particular, major support has been given by heavy-weight 'Richie Hawtin' who has been playing this track everywhere from clubs in Japan to Time Warp in New York, so make sure to check this one out.
												<BR><BR> Dandoczi is no stranger to the DJ booth and for an act still in the early stages of his career is no stranger to the airport either. Having played at numerous internationally parties around the world in places such Amsterdam, Köln Germany, Cluj Bucharest, Romania, London and Ireland to name but a few he is certainly already comfortable and experienced at setting the vibe in the club. Patrick makes full use of these opportunities to test out his productions while on the road. This allows him to see exactly how his tracks go down on the floor before being finally released - giving him the opportunity to make the small adjustments needed that producers can fail to make. Check out this guys social media accounts (linked below) to get a real feel for what damage his productions are capable of in the live environment.  
												<BR><BR> Patrick's weekly radio show 'Global Sound' on the infamous 'Data Transmission' platform has been given a fresh new slot this year - a clear sign that he is moving in the right direction. Catch him playing Saturday night from 6pm - 7pm. Be sure to keep a third ear out his own upcoming productions - if like us your familiar with his style you'll become an early witness to some masterful sounds.  
												<BR><BR> Early this year Patrick has brought news of his very own (strictly Techno) record label 'Advanced Music'. For the producers reading this - inside word is he'll be looking to get more than a few artists on board so if you have tracks sitting it could well be worthwhile sending in some demos. Dandoczi being already heavily involved with 'Day & Night Recordings' - a Tech House & Techno label ran by his close friend Andry Cristian knows exactly what is needed to get a label properly up and running. We have confidence with some time and effort 'Advanced Music' will be a platform to discover top quality productions and artists.

														Recently we caught up with Patrick to ask him a few questions about his journey so far.
												<BR>
												<BR>	<b class ="yellowbackground"> Well Patrick, to kick things off - how long have you been producing music for? </b>
												<BR><BR> I’ve been producing for around about 3 – 3 ½ years.
 
												<BR><BR> <b class ="yellowbackground"> Originally you started DJing, what made you get into the producing side of things? </b>
												<BR><BR> Naturally as a DJ I wanted to start producing - now-a days as a DJ you just won't get anywhere without spending some time on your own productions in the studio. I just really enjoyed making beats and experimenting with new sounds. 
																								
												<BR><BR> <b class ="yellowbackground"> Who are your musical influences? </b>
												<BR><BR> I grew up listening to this wide range of artists from Techno to Tech House to Afro House etc... Derrick May, Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson, Carl Craig, Deep'a & Biri, Jeff Mills, Richie Hawtin, Sven Väth, Marco Carola, Carlos Mena, Jimpster, Black Coffee, Moodymann and lots more that I’m missing.
												
												<BR><BR> <b class ="yellowbackground"> How would you sum up 2019 as a year for you? </b>
												<BR><BR> I’m glad to say that 2019 has been a great year - I’ve had gigs in Amsterdam, Ibiza, Bonn, Koln Germany, Cluj, Bucharest, Romania, Uk and all over Dublin. This is all thanks to my absolute ground breaking booking agency based here in Ireland “Advanced Booking Agency” and label 'Day&Night Recordings' also based in Dublin. 
												
												<BR><BR> <b class ="yellowbackground"> Can you tell us anything more about "Advance Booking Agency"? </b>
												<BR><BR> “Advanced Booking Agency” is ran by my father Silviu Dandoczi and Vlad Mihacea (MVI). All of the artists on the agency are super artists and friends of mine.	
												
												<BR><BR> <b class ="yellowbackground"> Whats upcoming with you in terms of releases and gigs for 2020? </b>
												<BR><BR> I have a new release coming very soon on my brand new Label “Advanced Music”. This release is going to be super huge, two banging Techno tracks - one heavy-hitting but also very groovy, the other heavy and more percussive which is a collaboration with my bro “MVI”. Gig wise I have nothing confirmed just yet I just know I’ll be back to smash Germany once more! The rest is a surprise...

												<BR><BR> <b class ="yellowbackground"> Anything else you want to add? </b>
												<BR><BR> Big artists to watch in Dublin this year my bros: Adrian Bilt (DeepTech, Tech House), Andry Cristian (Tech house, house), Andrew Azara (House, Minimal), The DirtBirdz (Techno), Erick Khalifa (Melodic Techno) and some more...
