												<BR>	 Opening a nightclub within Ireland although an exciting venture comes with a lot of work and is by no means an easy feat to achieve. With numerous rules, laws and regulations much must be considered before opening doors to the public. Currently the hottest issue of all within the nightclub industry and community of Ireland is the topic of opening hours and licensing. Irish nightclub opening hours are significantly shorter than that of our European cousins. Our licensing laws and closing times are proving it to be difficult and expensive to operate as a nightclub. Current licensing fees at €410 for every late night of opening are crippling the nightclub industry and leading to job losses throughout the country and many feel something needs to be done.
												<BR> 
												<BR>	<b class ="yellowbackground"> Publican licensing background in Ireland  </b>
												<BR><BR> Irish licensing law currently holds a somewhat standard pub or bar license called an Ordinary Public License (OPL) if you wish to open a regular bar or pub. Obtaining one of these licenses allows your business to operate Monday to Thursday 10.30am to 11.30pm, Friday and Saturday 10.30am to 12.30am and Sunday 12.30am till 11pm and serve alcohol between these hours (Dublin Law Firm & Notary Public, 2018). When the latter time is reached alcohol must stop being served and a finishing up time of 30 minutes can be given (Dublin Law Firm & Notary Public, 2018). In this time consumers can finish drinking whatever drinks they have acquired prior to the bar closing (Dublin Law Firm & Notary Public, 2018). This license must be renewed every September. If a pub or bar wishes to extend these opening times and operate as a late hours bar or pub they must make an application for a Special Exemption Order.  
												<BR>  
												<BR>	<b class ="yellowbackground"> Nightclub licensing in Ireland  </b>
												<BR><BR> There is no such thing as a nightclub in Irish licensing legislation. Nightclubs in Ireland are currently licensed under the Public Dance Halls Act 1935. Businesses aiming to operate as a nightclub under/with a Public Dance License must also apply for a Special Exemption Order (SEO). Here the licensee applies to the district court for exemptions to the regular closing time, for which they pay a fee. Although these SEO’s do allow later opening times where they can serve alcohol until a later hour, they limit successful applications to open until 2.30am Monday to Saturday and 1am on Sundays. On Sunday nights proceeding a bank holiday Monday the business may operate till the later time of 2.30am. Nightclubs using a SEO must shut their bar 30 minutes prior to closing time. This 30-minute period is drinking up time, during which it is illegal to provide entertainment or music. In Ireland there is no legal exceptions to these rules.  												
												
												<BR><BR>	<b class ="yellowbackground"> The Irish Nightclub Industry Association (INIA)  </b>
												<BR><BR> The INIA was set up in 1985 to represent Irish nightclub owners, promoters and industry professionals. With the word nightclub unheard of within Irish legislation the INIA proposed a nightclub-licensing permit to be put in place around the time of 2007/2008. The goals of the INIA at this time were to essentially lower the nightly cost of nightclub operation and extend opening hours whilst also addressing some other smaller matters. The INIA planned to have a number of rules and regulations in place for any business that wanted operate under a nightclub-licensing permit. If these rules and regulations were not followed they simply wouldn’t obtain a nightclub license permit or if already issued it would be withdrawn. The INIA wanted to impose a 3-tier system where OPL venues would stop serving alcohol at currently agreed times, late bars at 2:30am and Dublin nightclubs at 4.00am. A 30-minute drink period would then follow meaning late bars being fully closed at 3.00am and nightclubs at 4.30am. The proposed nightclub permit by the INIA would need to be renewed annually. 												
											
												<BR><BR> Currently for every night of operation a cost of €410 is paid by nightclubs to ensure they can legally operate to the later hours of the night irrespective of capacity. This fee is broken into a fee of €300 per SEO with an additional amount of €110 to be paid as excise duty. The costs of SEO’s to Irish nightclubs are huge and making it extremely difficult for small venues to operate profitably. On average a Dublin nightclub operating 5 nights a week would spend over €106,000 in SEO expenses each year. On average nightclubs outside of Dublin operating 4 nights a week would spend over €85,000 in SEO expenses each year. Comparing this to the UK where the cost for a similar license that allows even greater opening times costs around €2500 per year. An annual permit would significantly reduce costs for businesses operating under the proposed nightclub permit. 
												
												<BR><BR> Unfortunately much of the effort of the INIA had gone to waste or been ignored as they were not considered successful in carrying their proposal into legislation. After little success and lack of change, the INIA is today considered now somewhat dissolved and non-existent.  
												
												<BR><BR>	<b class ="yellowbackground"> Opening Times: Ireland v Europe  </b>
												<BR><BR> Similar to Ireland no European country has a designated nightclub license. However unlike Ireland many European countries allow the licensing of special permits that allow nightclubs to operate and stay open for much longer time lengths. Interestingly with the exception of Sweden, all countries contain cases where nightclubs operate 24 hours a day. Nearly all European countries have passed permission for local / regional authority’s to pass conditions onto their nightclub operational hours. From research carried out in 2008 by the INIA it is evident Irish legislation treats its nightclub industry very differently to that of similar European countries. Where Europe looks and treats cases individually Ireland has a one-size fits all approach. Below are the results of the research done by the INIA on existing licensing comparison between European countries and Ireland. Note this research although carried out in 2008 is still relevant even considering it was carried out 11 years ago. 
												
												<BR><BR> From the results above it is clear Ireland treats and sees its nightclub industry different to that of how other European countries treat their own. Note how Ireland is the only country that only has national laws set in place for its nightclubs where every other country sets local and national. Further note how capital city exemptions and special provisions are set in place for every country apart from Ireland.   

												<BR><BR>	<b class ="yellowbackground"> Give Us The Night </b>
												<BR><BR> Give Us The Night is a volunteer group ran by professionals within the music industry whose aims are to protect the Irish nightclub industry. Recently this group has opened up public talks once again about how to change nightclub opening hours and legislation affecting Irish nightclubs. With what may be considered success in the past (2004), Give Us The Night fought successfully against proposals to reduce nightclub opening times by one hour. Give Us The Night feel that now is the time to change nightclub legislation in Ireland and improve the current situation on expensive licensing and short opening times.

												<BR><BR>	<b class ="yellowbackground"> Implications of later Irish Opening Times </b>
												<BR><BR> If granted permission Irish nightclubs may currently extend their opening hours until 2.30am Monday to Saturday and 1am on Sundays however for most this is not enough. According to Give Us The Night later opening hours for our nightclubs would bring numerous advantages. Competition between late bars and nightclubs would be less direct resulting in both types of business operating more viably and independently. 
												
												<BR><BR> Later opening hours on Sunday’s would result in a substantial increase in business and revenue as it serves as part of the weekend and remains a very popular night for most consumers. Later nightclub opening hours would result in greater employment both directly and indirectly. Later hours means more staffing is needed within nightclubs from security to barmen to management, and as opening hours extend more jobs in the late night industry are indirectly similarly created. For example, late night restaurants, taxis etc. 
												
												<BR><BR> Later nightclub opening hours or sequential closing times would result in less disruption on the streets. Currently emergency services suffer great stress and are over stretched around the closing time of venues. Having places close later or on a tiered system reduce burden on services to deal with our current street crisis at 2:30am every weekend. Many other European countries market themselves to tourists on late nightlife. Allowing later nightclub opening times Ireland could market themselves in similar manors resulting in a much bigger tourism industry than what we already have. 
												
												<BR><BR> Currently the SEO application process is expensive at €410 per every night of extended opening hours. This expense makes it extremely difficult for smaller venues to operate profitably. A change in legislation where perhaps an annual permit was available would result in small venues being able to operate more profitably. 
												
												<BR><BR> Quite clearly out of the 28 countries within the European Union the way Ireland sees and treats its nightclub industry is much different to that of how our neighbouring countries treat their own. With talks having opened back up about how to initiate change it cannot be questioned that the professionals involved in running this industry are unhappy with how things are right now. While some of the bigger venues manage to survive, it is the many small to mid sized venues that really struggle to turn a profit from high cost nights with just a few hours of opening time. Why has legislation not been changed with what seems like so many advantages? Is it simply a matter of traditional views and stubbornness of the Irish political leaders and rule makers?
	
												<BR><BR> According to Sunil Sharpe an Irish Dj who spoke out at a Give Us The Night meeting, change is overdue and if we move as one collective change will have to come. At the meeting Sunil said: “100% this is going to change and it’s not going to be that 24-hour licensing is going to be parachuted into Ireland one night, but it will change slowly but surely and I really feel the politicians of now, rather than hold back the night- time industry – just do it now, be remembered for something that is going to come in anyway.”
												<BR><BR> We have to agree in that it will be some time before we have a scene like Berlin on our hands and that changes will be slow, however it is inevitable change will come. The number of advantages far outweighs the amount of drawbacks to a change in nightclub licensing and it is only a matter of time before Irish politicians see this. We are hopeful changes will be made.
